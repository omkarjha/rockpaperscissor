# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Introduction
Hey Everyone!! My name is Omkar Abhishek Jha.</br>
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Python. The program allows users to play the game against the computer.

## How to Play
1.Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.</br>
2.Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.</br>
3.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.</br>
4.Run the following command to start the game:</br>
Copy code
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```
5.The game will display instructions and prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).</br>
6.After you make your choice, the computer will randomly select its choice.</br>
7.The game will determine the winner and display the result.</br>
8.You can choose to play again or exit the game.</br>

## Implementation Details
The game is implemented using Python's random module to generate the computer's choice. It uses a simple set of rules to determine the winner:

•Rock beats scissors</br>

The program validates user input to ensure it is one of the valid choices (rock, paper, or scissors). It also provides error handling for unexpected inputs.</br>
